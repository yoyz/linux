# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# A 64-bit Linux standalone program that writes "Hello, World" to the console
# using system calls only.  The program does not need to link with any external
# libraries at all.
#
# System calls used:
#   1: write(fileid, bufferAddress, numberOfBytes)
#   60: exit(returnCode)
#
# Assemble:
#     gcc -c hello.s
# Link:
#     ld hello.o (to produce a.out)
#     (or) ld -o hello hello.o (to produce hello)
#
# Or, you can assemble and link in one step:
#     gcc -nostdlib hello.s
#
# The symbol _start is the default entry point for ld.
