change log for vectorclass.zip
------------------------------

2013-10-04 version 1.10
  * clear distinction between boolean vectors and integer vectors for the sake of 
    compatibility with mask registers in forthcoming AVX512 instruction set
  * added function if_add
  * tentative support for clang version 3.3 with workaround for bugs
  * remove ambiguity for builtin m128i operator == in clang compiler. 
  * problems in clang compiler, bug reports filed at clang
    (http://llvm.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=17164, 17312)
  * instrset.h fixes problem with macros named min and max in MS windows.h
  * workaround problem in MS Visual Studio 11.0. Bug report 735861 and 804274
  * minor bug fixes


2013-03-31 version 1.03 beta
  * bug fix for Vec2d cos (Vec2d const & x), VECTORMATH = 1


2012-08-01 version 1.02 beta
  * added file vector3d.h for 3-dimensional vectors
  * added file complexvec.h for complex numbers and complex vectors
  * added file quaternion.h for quaternions
  * added function change_sign for floating point vectors
  * added operators +, -, *, / between floating point vectors and scalars to remove overloading ambiguity


2012-07-08 version 1.01 beta
  * added file decimal.h with Number <-> string conversion functions: 
    bin2bcd, bin2ascii, bin2hex_ascii, ascii2bin
  * added andnot function for boolean vectors
  * added functions shift_bytes_up and shift_bytes_down
  * added operators for unsigned integer vector classes: >>=, &, &&, |, ||, ^, ~
  * inteldispatchpatch.cpp removed. Use asmlib instead (www.agner.org/optimize/#asmlib)
  * prefix ++ and -- operators now return a reference, postfix operators return a value
  * various improvements in permute and blend functions
  * minor improvement in abs function
  * added version number to VECTORCLASS_H


2012-05-30 version 1.00 beta
  * first public release
